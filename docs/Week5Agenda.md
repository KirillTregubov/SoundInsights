# Week 5 Agenda

Meeting time: Wednesday, 12/10/2022 at 6:30 p.m.
Members: Kirill, Eddie, Burt, Roger

## Before the meeting

- Each member should familiarize themselves with the Assignment 2 handout posted by the professor.

## During the meeting

1. Create a blameless postmortem on Assignment 1 (est. 20 min)

   - Did we achieve the following goals:
     - Everyone is content with the dataset and technologies we chose
     - Everyone is comfortable with / thinks they can handle what they are currently assigned to
     - Everyone is content with the meeting schedule and format
     - Our development environment can be installed on a clean machine in one step on all major operating systems
     - Our project builds in one step
     - Our tests cover our entire application and are run in one step
     - We are conveying enough of our processes to readers of our repo
   - Did we miss any of the aforementioned goals, if so by how much?
   - Do we need to change our plans based on the remaining time and project scope?
   - Do we need to make any adjustments / decisions based on what we have learned about project scope and capacity?

1. Discuss details related to the Assignment 2 handout, including: (est. 15 min)

   - Which parts of the project we can automate
   - What our heuristic for prioritizing tasks over one-another looks like
   - What is our acceptance criteria for sub-tasks, should we have a few for different "types" of tasks (code, research, integration)

1. Come up with the milestones we want to focus on and concrete features we intend to implement within the next three weeks (duration of Assignment 2) and separate them into sub-tasks accomplishable within a week. Assign each tasks to a "task leader". (est. 45 min)

   - List of possible sub-tasks:
     - Changing the backend to Anaconda (a Python distro)
     - Implementing Continuous Integration
     - Implementing Continuous Deployment

1. Decide which tasks to schedule for completion by next week (est. 10 min)

## After the meeting

- Each member should do some research / start the sub-tasks assigned to them and

- We will discuss all the details related to the milestones we are prioritizing in the next meeting.
