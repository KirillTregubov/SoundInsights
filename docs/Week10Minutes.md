# Week 10 Minutes
November 24, 2022

### Recap
- Burt is done the first task but not the second
   - We don't have data for him to manipulate/test with
- Eddie finished his task early in the week
- Kirill finished both tasks in the same PR
- Roger has an issue with caching but the model is fully integrated into the backend with 48% accuracy, reads from env variables

### [Blameless retrospective on A2](/docs/A2Postmortem.md)

### Assign tasks for next week

Burt:
- Finish playlist fetching from Spotify
- Once endpoints are implemented, experiment with resulting data

Kirill:
- Create endpoints/functionality to fetch top user tracks and tracks in specific top playlists
- Create tool that allows all team members to tinker with visualization by offering inputs to change data used to generate the graphs

Eddie:
- Make endpoint that accepts playlist `track_uri`s
- Start implementing logging (figure out how to log local shell scripts + commands run inside Docker)
- OPTIONAL: modify README with changes outlined in last week's minutes

Roger:
 - fix caching in the ML model and merge PR
