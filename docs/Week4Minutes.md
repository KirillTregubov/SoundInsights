Burt started opening an issue about open website url on launch
Kirill started a project of ‘to do’ list

fill the question in tech_stack. 
container(docker):
- pros: 
  - allows us to separate the frontend and backend environments.
  - allows us to install the dependencies and run both in one command.
  - allows us to package the final product as an image.

- cons:
  - fairly steep learning curves.
  - hard to make the script that installs on all operating systems.
  - requires the user to have docker installed.

Something to think about:
- Think of ML algorithms that are reasonably easy for us to implement.
- Implement caching on a need-to-use basis.

For A2:

- In Docker, replace Python with an Anaconda distribution (for the backend).

- Input From User: TBD
- Output From Frontend: TBD

- Input to PY: 3 properties (chosen from 3 fixed sets of properties) specified.
- Output from PY: An SQL query from those properties.

- Output From Frontend: TBD
