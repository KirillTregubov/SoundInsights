	3. Writing code to display that cool info on screen.
	4. A container to hold all our code in.
## During the meeting
1. Kirill will take meeting notes.
2. Discuss workloads, schedules, educational goals, available hardware (est 10 mins.)

4. Do the following for each step in part (2) of “Before the meeting”. (est 45 mins.)
	1. Discuss various alternatives for tech that can help us succeed.
	2. Agree on which tech stack and toolchain to use.
	3. Discuss our levels of expertise with this tech
	4. Write down why what we picked are good technologies (ex. Good for the task, familiarity).
	5. Write down the risks associated with using that technology (ex. Time consuming, new ecosystem, etc.).
5.  Write up a project plan (consult A1 document). (est 30 mins.)
	1. 3-4 milestones.
	2. For each milestone, specific tasks that need to be done.
	3. Assign who will be responsible for what - responsible doesn’t mean you have to do it alone, just be the leader on that particular task

## After the meeting
Work on the next actions we decided. We’ll say this is due next Wednesday before our next meeting. This way we can use the next meeting to report our progress and have time to run through the project to prepare for the next week’s worth of work.
