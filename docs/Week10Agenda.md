# Week 10 Agenda

Go over tasks from last week ([ref](https://github.com/KirillTregubov/csc302/blob/main/docs/Week9Minutes.md#tasks-for-next-week)).

Blameless retrospective on A2.

Assign tasks for next week:
- Any tasks carried over from last week.
- Add logging to our codebase.
- Update the README with stuff we covered from the A3 outline ([ref](https://github.com/KirillTregubov/csc302/blob/main/docs/Week9Minutes.md#we-then-covered-the-a3-outline)).
- Add integration tests that encode our milestones.

P.S. Next week we'll set up the production environment and work on the presentation.
